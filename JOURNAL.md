# May 24th: Started on the PCB and BOM

I set up my repo, started to make the PCB layout and a BOM (I know there is a better way to route, but I think it looks cool)

Time Spent: 3h 31m

# May 26th: Changed PCB layout and added more to the BOM

I decided that remaking the teensy 4.1 as the fist thing was a bad idea and switched to the breakout board insted, I'm about 60% with the schematic and BOM.

# June 4th: Started work on custom Teensy 4.1 and added a level shifter to the servo lines

I started work on remaking the teensy removed the I2C level shifter and added one to the PWM lines, I also swaped all the capacitors and resistor parts from 603 to 805.
