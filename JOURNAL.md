# May 24th: Started on the PCB and BOM

I set up my repo, started to make the PCB layout and a BOM (I know there is a better way to route, but I think it looks cool)

Time Spent: 3h 31m

# May 26th: Changed PCB layout and added more to the BOM

I decided that remaking the teensy 4.1 was a bad idea and switched to the breakout board insted, I'm about 75% with the schematic and BOM.
